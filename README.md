# Scalable-Data-Analysis-using-Pandas (Python)
Motivated by helpful way to spread awareness about environment and role of environmental resources on economy, I worked on World Bank Datasets to derive useful results on Carbon Emission, Forest Cover and corresponding GDP of the region and influence of environment on the economy. I worked on Pandas and Matplotlib libraries of Python to create data visualization. Data cleaning done using ipython notebook on Anaconda. Goal of the project is to learn more about visualization of large dataset elements on a scalable platform and better analyze the trends and picture of valuable informations. 

Overall, Conclusion of the Project is "Environmental exploitation is not a right way to grow Economy".
